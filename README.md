## Background
At the young age of 13 in 2012, I embarked on my programming journey through Tumblr, which became the gateway to my passion for web development 👩🏻‍💻. With great enthusiasm, I immersed myself in the world of programming, utilizing Tumblr as my platform of choice. It was there that I discovered the power of HTML and began implementing it to structure and design captivating frontend pages. As I delved deeper into the possibilities, I eagerly embraced JavaScript, leveraging its capabilities to add interactivity and dynamic elements to my creations💗. Alongside these technologies, I also honed my skills in CSS, harnessing its potential to enhance the visual appeal and style of my webpages. Through Tumblr, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in frontend development, laying the foundation for my journey as a web developer. I pursued my studies in Applied Mathematics and Computing(UNAM) 💻 🧑‍🎓, with a stronger emphasis on computing than mathematics 🤷🏻‍♀️.
