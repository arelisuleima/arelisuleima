#### Hi?
My name is Areli Suleima although some people call me Are, Ara, Sule or simply Areli. 🙇‍♀️

I have been in the world of programming for about 10 years, currently I am a Technical Consultant in Oracle technologies, although I certainly dedicate most of my time to PeopleSoft(PeopleCode) and Oracle Cloud(Java and APEX). 👓

My first encounter with code development was when I was 13 thanks to Tumblr 💙, HTML was my first enemy and at the same time a great friend. 

I studied Applied Mathematics and Computing 💻 🧑‍🎓(More computing than mathematics lol)

I currently know how to program in Swift, Python, Javascript,Typescript, PL/SQL, SQR, PeopleCode and recently Java.

#### About me:
- Strongly involved in the world of K-pop (ARMY? hell yes I am) 💜
- That I have studied mathematics does not mean that I am a human calculator.
