##### Hi?
My name is areli suleima although some people call me Are, Ara, Sule or simply Areli.
I have been in the world of programming for about 10 years, currently I am a Technical Consultant in Oracle technologies, although I certainly dedicate most of my time to SQL and PL/SQL.
My first encounter with code development was when I was 13 thanks to Tumblr, HTML was my first enemy and at the same time a great friend.
