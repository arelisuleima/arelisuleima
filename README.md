## ⭐Fun Facts
- Beyond my passion for programming, I am deeply immersed in the world of K-pop (ARMY? Hell yes, I am!) 💜
- While I studied mathematics, I don't possess the powers of a human calculator.
- My emotional stability heavily relies on the presence of my beloved cat 🐱
- "*Divine feminine, I'm feminine (why?)*" 💗♀️
- I am very good making draws and creative. In fact, I am so good that I don't need to use any tools or materials. I just use my mind and imagination. I can draw anything I want with just a thought. For example, yesterday I drew a unicorn flying over a rainbow 🦄. It was so beautiful and realistic that I almost cried.
