## Background
My journey into code development began at the age of 13, thanks to Tumblr. HTML was both my first adversary and a great companion. I pursued my studies in Applied Mathematics and Computing 💻 🧑‍🎓, with a stronger emphasis on computing than mathematics (though I won't claim to be a human calculator!).

## Professional Experience
As a Technical Consultant in Oracle technologies, I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects involving PeopleSoft and Oracle Cloud. From designing and implementing PeopleCode solutions to developing robust applications in Java and APEX, I bring a breadth of experience and expertise to every endeavor.
